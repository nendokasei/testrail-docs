# Overview

In TestRail, test cases are organized into sections and subsections.

Sections and subsections are a collection of test cases and are often created for specific project modules or areas of your product. Test cases of a test suite can be grouped into different sections. Sections are used to organize test cases into groups to make it easy to identify related test cases at high to low-level design.

If you have a lot of test cases for a project module, it is recommended to further break down your sections and create subsections for specific features or functionality.

For example, if you use multiple test cases to verify a specific application dialog or web page, these test cases should be grouped in a section.
